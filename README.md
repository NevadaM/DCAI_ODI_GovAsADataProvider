# Methods to assess the UK government's current role as a data provider for AI - Neil Majithia, Open Data Institute
This repo provides the data and code underlying the experiments presented in [this technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09632), summarised and discussed in the ODI report "The UK government as a data provider for AI" ([link](https://theodi.org/insights/reports/the-uk-government-as-a-data-provider-for-ai/)) - a piece that analyses what the results of the experiments mean in the wider context of government-enabled AI development and provides recommendations for the UK to take forward in the coming years.

The code isn't annotated to the best level, but I used functional programming and differentiated files so it should be clear what does what in the scripts. Reading alongside the technical report would help in that regard. Contact me if you have any questions at neil.majithia@theodi.org or neil.majithia@live.co.uk, or alternatively open an issue.
